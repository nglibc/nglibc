This repo contains scripts written for GKISS Linux to remove bash dependencies. Scripts are hosted in this repo to avoid taking up space in grepo.

Though these scripts were developed for GKISS, they should be functional on other linux distributions as well.

Subfolders show which package the scripts are used for.
